# Introduction

Nextflow is one of the most popular workflow managers used in bioinformatics. In this section, we will run through [this tutorial](https://training.nextflow.io/2.1.1/hello_nextflow/). If you are interested, there is also a nice [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPZ8WHdZGxmXiHf8B26oB_fTfoKQdhlik) that will walk you through these sections.

Some nextflow scripts will be added to the "bioinf_intro" section of this repository in order to help show how these would these scripts could be turned into a final deliverable product. 

NOTE: I use a cowsay image directly from DockerHub instead of the container image created in the tutorial. Because of this, I have also named my file and process "cowsay" instead of as "cowpy".

WARNING: The report generation and using conda environments seem to fail when working from a flox environment so I skipped running this with conda and the report generated has an error.
